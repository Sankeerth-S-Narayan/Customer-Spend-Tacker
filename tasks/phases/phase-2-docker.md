# 🐳 Phase 2: Docker Environment Setup - Detailed Tasks

This document breaks down the technical steps for containerizing the application services based on our discussion.

---

### Task 2.1: Create Placeholder Application Files
- [x] **Create `backend/requirements.txt` and `frontend/requirements.txt`:** Create the requirement files to store Python dependencies.
- [x] **Create `backend/main.py`:** Create an empty placeholder file to serve as the FastAPI application entrypoint.
- [x] **Create `frontend/main.py`:** Create an empty placeholder file to serve as the Panel application entrypoint.
> **Summary:** The foundational files for the backend and frontend services have been created. This includes `requirements.txt` files with initial dependencies for both services, and placeholder `main.py` entrypoint files for both FastAPI and Panel. This prepares the project for Dockerization, as the Dockerfiles will have the necessary source files to copy and build upon.

---

### Task 2.2: Create Backend Dockerfile
- [x] **Create `backend/Dockerfile`:** Write a Dockerfile to containerize the FastAPI application. It will use the `python:3.11-slim-bookworm` base image, set up a working directory, copy the requirements file, install dependencies, and define the command to run the server.
> **Summary:** A `Dockerfile` was created for the backend service. It leverages the `python:3.11-slim-bookworm` base image for a lean and secure foundation. Key steps include creating a non-root user for improved security, copying and installing dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and exposing the FastAPI application on port 8000. This file fully prepares the backend to be built as a container image.

---

### Task 2.3: Create Frontend Dockerfile
- [x] **Create `frontend/Dockerfile`:** Write a Dockerfile for the Panel application. It will also use the `python:3.11-slim-bookworm` base image and be structured similarly to the backend Dockerfile.
> **Summary:** The `Dockerfile` for the frontend Panel application has been created. It follows the same secure, non-root user pattern as the backend Dockerfile. The file defines the command to serve the Panel application on port 5006 and is configured to allow websocket connections, which is essential for Panel's interactive features. This completes the containerization setup for the frontend.

---

### Task 2.4: Set up `docker-compose.yml`
- [x] **Create `docker-compose.yml`:** In the project root, create the main Docker Compose file.
- [x] **Define Backend Service:** Add the `backend` service, configure its build context, map port `8000:8000`, mount the source code as a volume, and add a healthcheck.
- [x] **Define Frontend Service:** Add the `frontend` service, configure its build context, map port `5006:5006`, and mount the source code.
- [x] **Define Database Service:** Add the `db` service using the `postgres:16` image. Configure port `5432:5432`, link it to the `.env` file for credentials, set up a named volume for data persistence, and add a healthcheck using `pg_isready`.
> **Summary:** The `docker-compose.yml` file has been created, defining the entire application stack. It includes services for the backend, frontend, and database, with live-reloading volumes for development. Healthchecks have been implemented for the database and backend to ensure a controlled startup order, and a persistent volume is configured for the database to prevent data loss. This file is the centerpiece of our containerized environment.

---

### Task 2.5: Final Testing (After Docker Installation)
- [x] **Populate `.env` file:** Add the necessary PostgreSQL credentials to the `.env` file.
- [x] **Test Full Stack:** Once Docker Desktop is installed and running, execute `docker-compose up --build` to build the images and start all services.
- [x] **Verify Services:** Confirm that all three containers (`backend`, `frontend`, `db`) are running successfully.
> **Summary:** The `.env` file was populated with database credentials, and the full application stack was launched using `docker-compose up`. After debugging initial permission and volume issues, all services (`db`, `backend`, `frontend`) started successfully. The placeholder endpoints for the backend and frontend were verified to be accessible in the browser, confirming the Docker environment is correctly configured and operational.
