# ðŸ”™ Phase 4 (Redux): Backend (FastAPI) Setup - Simplified

This document outlines the new, simplified approach to building the FastAPI backend. To avoid the complexity and debugging issues from the previous attempt, all logic will be consolidated into a single `main.py` file first. This guarantees a working, testable product before we consider refactoring.

---

### Task 4.1: Install All Dependencies
- [x] **Update `requirements.txt`:** Add all necessary libraries for the database, security, and settings management in one go (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `psycopg2-binary`, `sqlalchemy`, `python-jose[cryptography]`, `passlib[bcrypt]`, `bcrypt`, `pydantic-settings`).
> **Summary:** The `requirements.txt` file has been updated with a complete and explicit list of all backend dependencies with pinned versions. This ensures a stable, reproducible build environment and avoids the dependency conflicts encountered previously.

---

### Task 4.2: Implement Backend in a Single File
- [x] **Implement all logic in `backend/main.py`:** Write the complete, working backend code in a single file. This includes:
    - Database connection and Pydantic settings management.
    - SQLAlchemy ORM models (`User`, `Transaction`).
    - Pydantic schemas for data validation.
    - Security functions (password hashing, token creation).
    - All API endpoints (`/login`, `/users/me`, `/transactions`, `/transactions/metrics`).
> **Summary:** A comprehensive FastAPI backend was implemented in a single `main.py` file following best practices. The implementation includes secure JWT authentication with bcrypt password hashing, SQLAlchemy ORM models for users and transactions, Pydantic schemas for request/response validation, and four key API endpoints. The backend provides robust error handling, token validation middleware, and seamless database integration with PostgreSQL.

---

### Task 4.3: Final Integration and Testing
- [x] **Rebuild and Test Backend:** Run `docker-compose up --build` to start the full stack.
- [x] **Test All Endpoints:** Use a tool like `curl` to test the `/login`, `/users/me`, `/transactions`, and `/transactions/metrics` endpoints to confirm the single-file API works correctly.
> **Summary:** The backend was successfully integrated with the Docker environment and all endpoints were thoroughly tested. The API correctly handles authentication, returns user-specific transaction data with filtering capabilities, and provides aggregated metrics including total spend, average amounts, and category breakdowns. All endpoints respond with proper HTTP status codes and JSON formatting, confirming the backend is production-ready.

### (Optional) Task 4.4: Refactor into Modules
- [ ] **Refactor the monolith:** Once the single-file app is working perfectly, break the code out from `main.py` into the professional, modular structure (`api`, `core`, `crud`, `db`, `models`, `schemas`).
