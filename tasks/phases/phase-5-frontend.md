### âœ… Phase 5: Frontend (Panel) Setup

**Goal:** To build an interactive web dashboard using Panel that allows a logged-in user to visualize and filter their spending data from the backend API.

*   **Task 5.1: Initial Setup & Dependencies**
    *   [x] Update `frontend/requirements.txt` with necessary libraries: `panel==1.4.1`, `pandas`, `holoviews`, `bokeh`, `requests`.
    *   [x] Create a modular file structure inside `frontend/` for better organization (e.g., `app/`, `app/views/`, `app/services/`).
    
    **Summary:** Established a robust frontend foundation with all necessary dependencies and a clean modular architecture. The project structure separates concerns with dedicated directories for views, services, and core application logic, following best practices for maintainable Panel applications.

*   **Task 5.2: API Client Service**
    *   [x] Create an `api_client.py` service to handle all communication with the backend.
    *   [x] Implement a function to handle `/login` requests.
    *   [x] Implement functions to fetch data from `/transactions` and `/metrics`, including passing the auth token in headers.
    *   [x] Add error handling for API requests (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, connection errors).
    
    **Summary:** Developed a comprehensive API client service that handles all backend communication with proper authentication token management. The service includes robust error handling for various scenarios and provides clean interfaces for login, transaction data retrieval, and metrics fetching.

*   **Task 5.3: Login View**
    *   [x] Create a `login_view.py` to define the login screen.
    *   [x] Add a title "Customer Spending Analytics".
    *   [x] Create username and password input widgets and a login button.
    *   [x] Implement the callback for the login button that uses the `api_client` to authenticate and stores the JWT token upon success.
    *   [x] Add a notification/alert for failed login attempts.
    
    **Summary:** Created a professional login interface with a clean design and proper user feedback. The login view handles authentication securely, provides clear error messages for failed attempts, and seamlessly transitions to the dashboard upon successful login.

*   **Task 5.4: Dashboard View & Layout**
    *   [x] Create a `dashboard_view.py`.
    *   [x] Use `pn.template.MaterialTemplate` for the layout.
    *   [x] Define a sidebar for filters and a logout button.
    *   [x] Define a main area for metrics and charts.
    
    **Summary:** Implemented a modern dashboard layout using Panel's MaterialTemplate with a responsive design. The layout features a sidebar for user controls and filters, and a main content area optimized for displaying analytics visualizations and metrics.

*   **Task 5.5: Dashboard Components**
    *   [x] **Metric Cards:** Create a function to display the `/metrics` data using `pn.indicators.Number`.
    *   [x] **Charts:**
        *   [x] Create a function to generate a bar chart for spending by category using HoloViews.
        *   [x] Create a function to generate a line chart for spending over time using HoloViews.
        *   [x] Create a function to generate a pie chart for category proportions using HoloViews.
    *   [x] **Filters:**
        *   [x] Create a `pn.widgets.DateRangeSlider` for date filtering.
        *   [x] Create a `pn.widgets.MultiChoice` for category filtering. The options for this should be dynamically populated based on the user's data.
    
    **Summary:** Built a comprehensive set of dashboard components including professionally styled metric cards, interactive charts (bar, line, and donut charts), and dynamic filter widgets. All components are properly integrated with the backend API and feature responsive design, hover tooltips, and cohesive blue color theming for a professional analytics dashboard appearance.

*   **Task 5.6: Integration & State Management**
    *   [x] In `main.py`, create a main controller class or function to manage application state.
    *   [x] Implement logic to show the `login_view` by default and switch to the `dashboard_view` upon successful login.
    *   [x] Store the JWT token securely in `panel.state.cache` or a similar state management approach.
    *   [x] Wire up the filter widgets to a callback function. This function will re-fetch data from the API using the new filter values and update all charts and metrics.
    *   [x] Implement the logout button functionality, which should clear the token and return to the login screen.
    
    **Summary:** Implemented a comprehensive AppController class in `main.py` that manages the complete application state and user flow. The controller handles secure JWT token storage using Panel's state cache, seamless view transitions between login and dashboard, and dynamic data filtering with real-time chart updates. The logout functionality properly clears authentication state and returns users to the login screen.

*   **Task 5.7: Final Polish & Testing**
    *   [x] Ensure the UI is responsive and handles empty states gracefully (e.g., when there is no data for a selected filter).
    *   [x] Test the complete user flow: login -> view dashboard -> apply filters -> logout.
    
    **Summary:** The frontend application is fully responsive and robust, handling edge cases like empty data states with appropriate alerts and messaging. All dashboard components (metric cards, bar chart, donut chart, line chart) are properly sized and styled for consistency. The complete user workflow has been tested and functions seamlessly from login through data visualization and filtering to logout.
