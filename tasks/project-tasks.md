# 📊 Full-Stack Analytics Platform – Task Breakdown

**Project:** Customer Spending Analytics Dashboard
**Author:** Sankeerth Sridhar Narayan
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 25, 2025

---

### 🔰 Phase 1: Project Initialization

**Setup Repo & Structure**
- [x] Create GitHub repo (`analytics-dashboard`)
- [x] Create core folders: `/frontend`, `/backend`, `/db`
- [x] Add `.gitignore` for Python, VSCode, and Docker
- [x] Create `.env` file with secrets and DB config
- [x] Initialize `README.md` with project overview

**Git Setup**
- [x] Create branches: `main`, `test`, `dev`
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules (if needed)
- [x] Set up basic commit/PR guidelines (conventional commits)

> **Phase 1 Summary:** The project foundation has been successfully established. A local Git repository was initialized, and the core branch structure (`main`, `dev`, `test`) was created. The project's directory structure (`frontend`, `backend`, `db`) was set up, and essential files including `.gitignore`, `.env`, and `README.md` were created and configured. The initial state of the project was committed, providing a clean baseline for future development.

### 🐳 Phase 2: Docker Environment Setup

**Docker & Compose**
- [x] Write `Dockerfile` for backend (FastAPI)
- [x] Write `Dockerfile` for frontend (Panel)
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL service in Docker
- [x] Create `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate services
- [x] Add volume for persistent DB data
- [x] Add healthcheck for backend & db
- [x] Test `docker-compose up` locally

> **Phase 2 Summary:** The entire application environment has been successfully containerized using Docker and Docker Compose. Individual `Dockerfile`s were created for the FastAPI backend and Panel frontend, following best practices for security and efficiency. The `docker-compose.yml` file was configured to orchestrate the startup of all three services, including a PostgreSQL database, with healthchecks to ensure proper dependency startup and a named volume for persistent data storage. After resolving initial build and runtime issues, the full stack is now running locally.

### 🧾 Phase 3: Database Design & Seeding

**Schema Creation**
- [x] Design SQL schema: `users`, `transactions`
- [x] Write `init.sql` to prefill users and mock transaction data
- [x] Load `init.sql` via Docker volume
- [x] Test DB connection from backend

> **Phase 3 Summary:** The database schema was designed and implemented with a focus on providing rich data for analytics. The `init.sql` script was created to define both `users` and `transactions` tables and was populated with a diverse set of mock data for three distinct user profiles. The database service was successfully rebuilt and tested, confirming that the schema and data are loaded correctly on container startup. The database is now fully prepared for the backend to interact with it.

### 🔙 Phase 4: Backend (FastAPI) Setup

**FastAPI Project Structure**
- [x] Create main FastAPI app (`main.py`)
- [x] Set up routing structure: `auth`, `transactions`, `metrics`
- [x] Create pydantic models for requests/responses
- [x] Use SQLAlchemy for ORM + DB session

**Auth Module**
- [x] Build `/login` endpoint with JWT generation
- [x] Create user model and auth logic
- [x] Add token validation middleware

**API Endpoints**
- [x] `/transactions`: Return filtered data for user
- [x] `/metrics`: Return aggregated stats (total, average, top categories)

> **Phase 4 Summary:** The FastAPI backend has been successfully implemented with a robust, single-file architecture that includes comprehensive JWT authentication, SQLAlchemy ORM integration, and four key API endpoints. The backend provides secure user authentication with bcrypt password hashing, token-based session management, and sophisticated data filtering capabilities for transactions and metrics. All endpoints have been tested and integrated with the Docker environment, providing a solid foundation for the frontend dashboard to consume analytics data.

### 🎨 Phase 5: Frontend (Panel) Setup

**Dashboard Layout**
- [ ] Set up basic Panel app with `pn.template`
- [ ] Build login screen → capture username/password
- [ ] Store token in session state

**Visual Components**
- [ ] Add summary metrics (total, average, top categories)
- [ ] Add filters: date range, category
- [ ] Add charts using Panel + Holoviews/Bokeh (bar, pie, line)

**API Integration**
- [ ] Call `/login` on login form submit
- [ ] Fetch `/transactions` and `/metrics` with token
- [ ] Re-render UI on filter changes

---

### 🧪 Phase 6: Testing

**Backend Unit Tests**
- [ ] Write test for `/login` (valid/invalid users)
- [ ] Write test for `/transactions` with filters
- [ ] Write test for `/metrics` output
- [ ] Add coverage with `pytest-cov`

**Frontend Functional Checks**
- [ ] Validate API calls return expected data
- [ ] Ensure filter selections update charts
- [ ] Test session handling (token reuse, logout)

---

### 🔁 Phase 7: CI/CD with GitHub Actions

**CI Pipeline**
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/main.yml`
- [ ] Add step for Python setup
- [ ] Install backend + frontend requirements
- [ ] Run `flake8` on both folders
- [ ] Run `pytest` on backend/frontend
- [ ] Run `black --check .` for formatting

**Lint & Format Tools**
- [ ] Add `flake8` config
- [ ] Add `black` config
- [ ] Add `pytest.ini` if needed

---

### 📦 Phase 8: QA + Future Extensions

**Cleanup & Polish**
- [ ] Add README instructions for local setup
- [ ] Add sample user credentials
- [ ] Tag `v1.0` release
- [ ] Archive and document learnings

**Future Ideas**
- [ ] Add new user signup
- [ ] Add more analytics KPIs (monthly change, transactions over time)
- [ ] Extend CI to build Docker images
- [ ] Plan for cloud deployment (Render, EC2, etc.)
